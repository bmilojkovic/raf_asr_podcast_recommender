
Has a lot of data
https://www.kaggle.com/mozillaorg/common-voice



The site claims this is an open database of 
voice data. Seems to be fine. nearly everything is labeled. 
Note: the file is .tar.gz so one needs to use 7zip
https://voice.mozilla.org/en/datasets


(again, file is .tar.gz)
A good file i think, will add it to the collection

Another good database

A set of numbers, but it is not labeled per se
the label is in the name itself

Another repository found on SLR
